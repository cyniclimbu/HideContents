HideContents
============
Gib moni pls!
Jk. This will hide contents of a directory.

This is a work of an amatuer self-made programmer who is not normal. :neckbeard:

Upcoming?
============
I might improve this code or I might not.

- Do what's it's supposed to but without having to log in? Okay :thumbsup:
- More to come?

This is actually a mini idea I had for my biggest project EVARR!!! which is, rootShell, of course. :grin: :grin:
940+ lines of code? Hell yeah. (1000+...on my laptop waiting for me to upload. AFTER I FINISH THEM OFC :disappointed_relieved: :disappointed:)
I keep getting mini ideas and I'm forced to work on them while the main project starts to rot or whatever. :worried:
